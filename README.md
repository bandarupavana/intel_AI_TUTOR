Abstract: Smart English Learning Web App for KG to 12th Grade
This project presents a smart, level-based English learning web application designed for students from Kindergarten (KG) to 12th grade. The platform aims to make English language learning engaging, structured, and suitable for students across a wide age and skill range.

Upon starting the app, learners are given a quick assessment quiz that helps place them into one of three learning levels:

1.Beginner

2.Intermediate

3.Advanced

This level-based system ensures that learners receive content suited to their current understanding, allowing for a smoother and more personalized progression through grammar, vocabulary, comprehension, and sentence-building topics.
Conclusion:

The Smart English Learning Web App stands out as an engaging and thoughtfully designed platform that caters to a wide spectrum of learners from KG to 12th grade. By combining an initial assessment-based placement system with level-specific content, it ensures that each student embarks on a personalized and effective learning path. Its vibrant design, interactive content, and simple navigation make it highly attractive and user-friendlyâ€”especially for young learners. This web application not only promotes consistent learning but also fosters confidence and curiosity in English language skills, making it a valuable educational tool for students and educators alike.
