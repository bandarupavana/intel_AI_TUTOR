            <h3>📝 Reading Passage:</h3>
            <p>
                As the applause faded, Eleanor stood motionless behind the curtain. Her name had been called, but she hesitated.
                Years of preparation, sacrifice, and ambition had led to this moment—a prestigious award for contributions to humanitarian work.
                But the weight of her silence over the past year lingered like a stone in her chest. She had seen things, known things.
                People praised her efforts, but they didn’t know the whole truth. They didn’t know about the young girl who had vanished
                from the village she had visited. Eleanor did nothing. Not because she didn’t care—but because she feared consequences.
                And now, as she stepped into the spotlight, the applause felt more like an accusation than admiration.
