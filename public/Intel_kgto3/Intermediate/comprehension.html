            <h3>The Lost Kitten</h3>
            <p>One sunny morning, Lily was playing in the garden when she heard a soft "meow." She looked around and saw a small kitten under a bush. The kitten looked hungry and scared. Lily gently picked it up and took it home.</p>
            <p>She gave the kitten some milk and wrapped it in a warm towel. "Don’t worry, little one," she said. After some time, the kitten felt safe and started purring. Lily’s mom helped her find the kitten’s owner. The neighbor, Mrs. Green, was so happy to see her lost kitten again!</p>
